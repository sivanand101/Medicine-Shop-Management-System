# Medicine Shop Management System. 

Desperate times calls for Desperate Measures. The Covid Times. 

Every Medicine shop, whether big or small in size and service needs a management system using which the staff can manage Records of Medicines, Patients, Doctors, Pharmaceutical Companies, Suppliers and many others. To provide something in return for their constant service during these desperate times and also to fulfill our Course Project DBMS, working in a team, I developed a Web Application using Django Framework and Python at Backend, HTML and CSS as an User Interface . 

Django's MVT was used to create the Relational Database and for basic CRUD operations which fulfilled almost all requirements of the Medicine Shops.
Kudos to the Team and efforts.
